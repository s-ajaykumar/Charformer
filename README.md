# Charformer [Research]

## Problem 
a. **Non-alignment with humans**: Existing tokenizers operate on **sub words** instead of words like humans does.  
b. **Huge sequence length**  
          
## Idea 
### Character level tokenization
### Character level decoding
Model   
a. Takes **character level** inputs  
b. Learns to form **words** from them  
c. Produces **character level** outputs.  
          
## Soln 
Implementing and testing multiple modifications in transformers. 
Code in **/src**
